# SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)

## Models

- waterfall
- agile
- spiral
- big bang


### Waterfall

Design the whole planning by one roadmap. (Generally months) Generally okey for certain (not add new features etc.) projects. Beginning and ending of the project is already set.

- 1. Requirement
- 2. Design
- 3. Implementation
- 4. Testing
- 5. Maintenance

#### Notes
**The next phase started only after previous phase is completed**
**Cannot accommodate changing requirements**
**No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.

### Agile

Divide whole planning into parts. With that way, new requirements or updates can be added because development process will be done part by part.
